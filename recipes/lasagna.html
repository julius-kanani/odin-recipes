        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>4 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture
                over the noodles. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, topping with 
                the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
